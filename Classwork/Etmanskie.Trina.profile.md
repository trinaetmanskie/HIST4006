Here is a list of reasons I joined HIST 4006A:
​
- because I enjoyed HIST3812 (Critical Making in Digital History) :books:
- increase my digital history skills (_whatever that means!_:flushed:)
- understand how I can better integrate digital tools into a classroom setting :apple:
- complete my 4th year prerequisites in order to graduate
