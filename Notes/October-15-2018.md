# Lecture 5: Writing Supports

**October 15**

**Lecture**

**Writing Supports**

## Reading Notes

1.    Consider what properties made certain writing supports more popular/efficient than others. Why do we think paper survived as the primary writing support since the MA?

2.    How did Christianity affect the literary culture of the Middle Ages? How did these changes, developments, etc dictate what was used to write stuff on?

3.    How did the shift throughout the middle ages from oral reading/writing to silent reading come about, and what are some of the ways those changes were reflected in writing supports?

4.    What are some potential challenges historians could face by trying to digitize different kinds of surviving writing supports?


*Quotes I enjoyed*
It’s easy to over­look the im­port­ance of empty space as a form of punc­tu­ation

Comma and colon - way of breaking up the text

“This gospel was sometimes employed as a protective talisman. “While many kinds of relic could be worn as amulets, books were particularly desirable, and there are multiple accounts of Gospels and Psalters (especially those linked with saints) being fitted with cord or placed in a pouch and worn on the body, a practice associated with books as early as the seventh/eighth-century Stonyhurst Gospel of St. Cuthbert,” 

Eusebian Canon
“Harmonizing the Gospels" means comparing the same story from different Gospels to obtain a greater understanding of its significance. Gospel Harmonies, sometimes called "Parallel Gospels" are still published today; you can find them in any good Christian book store, but instead of using Eusebius' numbers, the passages are printed in parallel columns.

McLuhan declared the invention of printing to be of pivotal importance because it had been responsible for the shift from an oral culture, in which communication was primarily through discourse and group readings of manuscripts books, to a visual culture in which men exchanged the ideas through the private silent reading of printed books
Private readings had usually been read outlaid (page 370)
Page 372, arrangement of the texts (emblems)
Page 378, word division began as an aid to oral reading but paradoxically it provided the sine qua non for the silent copying of the texts by medieval scribes.
“twelfth-century Cluniac monks were judged to have violated their vow of silence only when Word they spoke was not written in text”

## Lecture Notes

Writing Support
- thing that you write on
- Current society - transition from paper to digital age 

- Do writing supports change the way in which we scribe? Or does the oral culture change the way in which we use writing supports?

- Word spacing 
- Reading as a visual culture 
- Spoken vs silent 

- Wax and wood vs papyrus, parchment and paper 

- difference in longevity (of sources)
- Wrote curses in lead and threw it in a well 
- concern about permanence 
- Threw it down a well (to make it survive)

- Different mediums have different means of permanence 

- Made some books out of wood 
how paper is folded

- Parchment valued over paper
- because the ink would stay longer (all about materials)

- Paper wasn’t always made from trees (spoiler)

- What resources are available? What is cheaper?

- Cow skin - more popular for writing

What is parchment made out of?
- any animal skin but mainly cow, sheep and goat 
- [animal skin] Could also be used for binding 
- Human skin too (ew?)

- Physical properties of the writing support (such as parchment), what does this tell us about the society or culture where our book came from?

- worse quality 
- Visual appearance 
- If there were holes in it (worm wood?)
- Defective edge that had been fixed (it was important enough to be fixed)
- Made repairs to texts… what does that say about the text?

Importance, 
- ability to repair the text (means they are familiar with the text)
- Usability and function vs appearance 

- huge amount of thought that goes into creating these
- WHY? Important text 
- Not everyone could write so those who were writing down - wrote down what they thought was important 

- changes in the outside world changed what was written 
- Monks (in Ireland, edge of Roman Empire, didn’t really speak Latin like the Roman did - so they were not able to understand the writings (no spaces), no access to same sources as the Romans)
- Began using animal skins
- A time where long distant trade is collapsing 
- Innovations as a result of historical change 

- Texts - silent reading
- Originally it was for reading the texts outlaid (which is for everyone else listening)
Silent reading however is much more personal 

- very similar to how when we take notes for ourselves we take short hands (in today’s society)
- Depending on context and audience, we take different notes

### Evolving in writing

- Literacy
- Self-sufficiency
- More wide spread (now that it is available)
- Does this offer a threat to the church? Since people can read on their own - no need to go to church to listen to a pope

***Reading out loud vs reading silently***

- How we experience oral literature vs silently 
- when reading out loud we are:
- Slower
- Technology of the world 
- Memory 

The book itself is a form of technology 
- example of wanting to go back and reread (using a book vs a scroll)
- Chapters and table of contents 
- Categorizing their knowledge 
- Grouping ideas 
- Kodak format (I think thats how you spell it) for almost 1500 years

Organization - that is the same for each book 
- Standard knowledge 
 - a learned behaviour 
- Way in which you open a book, read the text, title (where to find it), how to hold the book,
- i.e reading Manga for the first time, or Arabic

- Hard cover book vs that we have soft cover (the way they are stacked in the shelf)

Title

Internal title

Table of contents, (located after the title (internal title page)) - need pagination 
	- in order for pagination, what about handwritten texts?
	- how to standardize what is written on each page 
	- Find a way to number - instead of numbers (so verses and chapters - the Bible)
	- Numbered by the text layout vs page numbers 

- Most copied book (in the middle ages and now) - The Bible
- think about the thickness of paper } imagine what it was like if it wasn’t the thin paper 
- Smaller books stuck together (I.e Book of John)
- break down the books into smaller sections with more meaning 
- Libraries: only existed within the Church institutions during this time - only ones that could afford this and had the resources for copying (during this time)

- Content of the book and the para-text

- Books are very sophisticated - taken for granted 
- When we understand the value of writing then we are more careful (they were much more careful then than we are now. i.e if I make a mistake I can just backspace, vs then they would have to get rid of the entire scroll, piece of parchment etc)

- Absorbency of a writing support
- Colour and texture
- Illumination (wood okay for this)
- Spreading alum on parchment to make it look whiter (can visually see the colour difference on Manuscript) - feels slightly different when touching it as well 

- Gutenberg, one of first printed books
- Goat skin (parchment), actually printed on parchment 
- One sheet acquires many layers
- made ink tackier (thick, almost like tar) 
- Could not use the ink that the monks were using
